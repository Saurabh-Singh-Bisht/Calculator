# Calculator
Calculator application using JAVA

•	Developed a basic calculator like the present in our mobile phones. This can perform all the basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

•	In this project I also added a special type of calculator called a Binary converter which takes a decimal number as input and outputs a Binary form of that number.

•	The User Interface (UI) and User Experience(UX) of this calculator are also very good.

•	Concepts Used: OOPs, Listener
•	IDE Used: IntelliJ.
